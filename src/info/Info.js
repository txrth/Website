    bio: "Hello! I'm Tirth. I'm in my third year of Mechanical Engineering at Western University doing a dual degree with Computer Science. I chose to do a dual degree because I have had a strong passion for robotics and mechanical systems. Also, I realise the future is heading to a place where mechanical systems will intertwine with software. Aside from studying, I have participated several clubs and projects, such as First Robotics Competition, Model Theme Park Ride, and Western Baja, to get hands on experiences. These experiences also helped develop my skills on 3D modeling, designing, time management, and collarbrating.",
